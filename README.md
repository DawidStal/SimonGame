# SimonGame
The Simon electronic memory skill game, invented in 1978 by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison,	
creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds,	
the series becomes	progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs	
out, the game is over.
The device has four coloured buttons, each producing a particular tone when it is pressed or activated
by the device. A round in the game consists of the device lighting up one or more butons in	a	random
order, afer which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the butons. As the game	progresses,
the number of buttons to be pressed increases.
